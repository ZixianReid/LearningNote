- target object
	- styrofoam triangle covered by a checkerboard-like pattern behind is a triangular corner retroreflector
	- for camera-radar calibration, using checkerboard to ensure intrinsic matrix of camera and get an accuracy pose of triangle based on extrinsics matrix.
- calibration mathmatical
	- two step optimization
	- First one: similar with DLT, get all pair points and minimize the error. It use LM for that
	- Second one: Optimize RCS. based on old radar, which means no elevation location information
	  But, this paper utilize the property that the RCS has proportion with elevation angel  to get the calibration enhance.
- Innvoation:
	- target object
	- RCS opt
- Tipsï¼š
	- our 4g mmw radar holds elevation information, this optimize approach may not suitable for us.
